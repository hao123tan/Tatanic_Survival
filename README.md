# Tatanic_Survival
Using Tensorflow to build model to complete Tatanic_Survival prediction

1. After download the original data from Kaggle, I just do the data preprocessing.
2. Then I translate these data into dataset by Tensorflow.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices.
3. Building a model with two hidden layer
4. using the dataset to train this model.
5. using trained model to predict survive people in test.csv.
